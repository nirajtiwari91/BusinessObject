In the provided code snippet, a UserObject instance named userObj is created, representing a Business Object in the application. This object encapsulates information related to a user, such as their first name, last name, gender, and country.

The properties of the UserObject—FirstName, LastName, Gender, and Country—are then set with specific values, assigning "Niraj" to the first name, "Tiwari" to the last name, "Gender" to the gender, and "India" to the country.

Subsequently, the saveUser method of an object named obj is called, passing the userObj as an argument. This method is responsible for saving or persisting the user information, possibly in a database or another storage medium.

In summary, the code demonstrates the instantiation of a UserObject, setting its properties with specific values, and invoking a method to save the user information using the created object. This encapsulation helps organize and manage user-related data in the application's business logic.
